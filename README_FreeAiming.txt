Free Aiming Patch
=================

Free aiming patch for Gothic, Gothic Sequel, Gothic 2 and Gothic 2 NotR


Settings
--------

Free aiming is available in two configurations that are accessible from the game menu.

OFF                     Use Gothic's traditional auto aiming

BALANCED                Free aiming in balanced configuration

REALISTIC               More difficult with additional modulators on accuracy:
                        - If the bow is not drawn to its full extend (see reticle animation),
                          - the shooting distance decreases (faster gravity drop)
                          - the accuracy decreases (lower hit chance)
                          - the damage output is reduced
                        - If the crossbow is not held steadily, i.e. no mouse movement (see reticle animation),
                          - the accuracy decreases (lower hit chance)
                          - the damage output is reduced
                        - The crossbow has a weapon recoil (vertical camera shift) depending on the player's strength.
                        - Moving while shooting reduces the accuracy by 20%
